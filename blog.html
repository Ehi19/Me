<p>It’s easy to get caught up in negativity. Between the constant news cycle, world events and social media, it can seem like the world is closing in on you. But please remember:

Protecting your mental health should be your first priority.</p>
<h2>Effect Of Shame</h2>

<p>Shame is a painful emotion caused by consciousness of guilt, shortcoming, or impropriety. Although very painful, the capacity for shame is healthy and part of being human. The function of shame is to prevent us from damaging our relationships and motivate us to repair them if we’ve damaged them.  </p>
<p>Where guilt says “I’ve done something wrong,” shame says “I am something wrong.”  

Some people grow up mostly feeling like they are fitting in and other people grow up with life circumstances that make them feel like an outsider. Some situations that may have made you feel chronically marginalized include:  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Having a chronic mental health condition, like anxiety, OCD, a mood disorder, or ADHD </li>
    <li>Being of a different race </li>
    <li>Speaking a different language  </li>
    <li>Having a different financial situation than those around you</li>
    <li>Experiencing something traumatic that other people around you didn’t experience </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you resonate with any of these situations, you might have a chronic sense of shame or a feeling of shame that pops up frequently. You didn’t do anything wrong. Your mind just perceived a difference between yourself and those around you and gave you a feeling.  <br><br>

Shame is “just” a feeling, but it can become very big and very painful. If it feels very big, it doesn’t mean there is something even worse about you, but rather that there are layers to it. We can make it smaller and more manageable by talking about it and listening to it. When you understand it and the feeling is smaller, it will be easier for you to work with it.  </p>
