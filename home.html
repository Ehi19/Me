<p>
A known pregnant woman who is three months gone walked into the health facility bleeding.
<br>
Madam, wetin happen. she said,
<br><br>

<br><br>
Medicine go do work wey dem no send ham, the leg sef no even go... cries.
<br><br>
(This woman bought herbal medicine to relieve leg pain but it ended up aborting her pregnancy.)
**********
<br><br>
I was listening and vexed in my spirit;
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Angry that she lost the pregnancy courtesy to them-say and Ignorance</li
>
<br>
<li>Angry that people who don't know how drugs work get to sell drugs to people</li>
<br>
<li>Angry that another person might become a victim of this.</li>
</ul>
<br>
She was attended to and counseled to avoid future occurrences, but she learned the hard way.
Thank God she survived.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Don't listen to advice from your neighbour who is not a health professional. If e cast na you go hear ram.</li><br>
<li>Don't patronize herbal drugs, if you must, get them from a reliable source.</li><br>
<li>Seek medical advice, patronize nearby health facilities, get a health professional contact, or subscribe to telehealth.</li><br>
<li>Read! Yes cultivate the habit of reading drug leaflets, know what you are about to take into your body.</li><br>
<li>Check the name, what the drug does, expiry date, side effects, and dosage most importantly.</li>
</ul>
<br>
DISCLAIMER: I am not against herbal medicine. Some are very effective.
<br><br>
The 101 disease it cures and the dosage is what I frown at.
<br><br>
How will you take half a bottle of herbs in the morning and at night? Abeg help me reason this matter.
